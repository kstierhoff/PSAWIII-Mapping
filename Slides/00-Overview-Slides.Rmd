## Welcome!
**PSAW-III: Mapping and Spatial Analysis in R! **

**About me:** 

+ Research Fisheries Biologist at NOAA's SWFSC (since 2008) 

+ **Research interests:** Monitoring and recovery of endangered white abalone, assessment of small pelagic fishes, advanced survey technologies (optics and acoustics), data science and reproducible research 

+ Learned **Matlab**  in 2007 (quit in 2009, see next bullet...)

+ **R** user since 2009 (thanks to Eric Archer and Jeff Laake, among others)

+ **Esri ArcGIS** user since 1998 (v3.1!)...trying to quit 

---

## Course Motivation
I had long been frustrated that mapping and other GIS-type tasks were the only part of my analysis and writing workflow that existed outside of R. 

With my desire to move toward more automated and reproducible workflows, it was imperative for me to learn the tools available to accomplish these same tasks in R.  

ArcGIS is (IMHO) expensive, cumbersome, and not-necessarily cross-platform. I REALLY wanted a free, open-source solution that would work on any of my workstations.

This course arose from a brief, 1 h-long R-User Group meeting in 2018, where I presented some things I had recently learned about mapping and spatial analysis using R (**and from your interest in this workshop!**).  

### Disclaimer(!):
I am **NOT** an expert in GIS or R, an expert on spatial analysis, nor a cartographer.

I **AM** _pretty_ good with R, have learned a LOT about making maps in R, and am **extremely** enthusiastic about eliminating the need for proprietary, stand-alone GIS software in my reproducible analysis workflow!

## Course Materials
All of the course materials are available via Github at https://github.com/kstierhoff/PSAWIII-Mapping. 

**If(Git)**, in Rstudio:
File>New Project>Version Control>Git and paste the link above into the Repository URL field.

**If(!Git)**, download the .zip file, extract the contents, and then open the PSAWIII-Mapping.Rproj file.

## Guiding Principles
There are many ways to accomplish mapping and spatial analysis tasks using R (e.g., `sp` package, [`RQGIS` package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/RQGIS/index.html), [`RSAGA` package](https://github.com/r-spatial/RSAGA), the [R-ArcGIS Bridge](https://r-arcgis.github.io/), etc.).  

**However**, I will focus on the prevailing workflows and packages used by the leaders in the R Spatial community, including:

+ Rstudio IDE and Rstudio Projects for analysis and organization, respectively 

+ `tidyverse` packages for data manipulation (e.g., `dplyr`) and visualization (e.g., `ggplot2`) 

+ `sf` package for creation, manipulation, and geoprocessing of spatial data 

+ `mapview` and `leaflet` for interactive data exploration

+ `terra` package for raster data*

_*Raster examples may be limited...it's presently my Achilles heel...and I'm running out of time to teach myself!_

## Survey Feedback (From PSAWII)
Prior to PSAWII (I forgot this time...), I polled the groups' participants. From that poll, their topics of interest could be summarized as follows: 

Participant info:
+ Intermediate R users or better 

+ Some experience with GIS (mostly ArcGIS) 

+ 50/50 Mac and PC users

Topics:
+ **Most Interested:** Basic mapping, tables, datums/projections, spatial/geometry operations 

+ **Less interested:** Interactive maps, animations, 3D maps 

+ **Not listed:** Animal movements, species distribution modeling, trade-offs

---

## Survey Feedback (cont.)
There were several concerns:  

+ Amount of hands-on time 

+ Lack of R/GIS knowledge

I hope to provide interactive programming sessions and hands-on time following slide presentations.

**PLEASE, DO NOT BE INTIMIDATED!**  I hope that the material presented will give you some inspiration to learn new tools and workflows as you build both your R and GIS skills. It'll also help once you can play with your own data and solve your own problems.  

_**Looking at the attendee list, many of you could be leading this workshop!**_
 
Things may move fast...but you'll have the code to peruse more leisurely anytime you'd like. Feel free to reach out with questions or discoveries that you make along the way.  

We have 4 hours set aside, but I don't think we'll run nearly that long. I'd like this to be as interactive as possible given we have almost 200 **(!)** attendees registered.

## Course Structure

The class will be structured into several modules:

+ **01-Introduction:** Basic mapping and data visualization (50%)

+ **02-Intermediate:** Spatial data manipulation and analysis (45%)

+ **03-Advanced:** Interactive maps, animations, and 3D visualization (5%)  

---

## Software recommendations
+ R (v4+, materials developed and tested on v4.1.2) 

+ Rstudio (v2022+, I'm running the latest Preview v2022.02.0) 

+ **Required packages will be loaded using the `pacman` package.** 

```{r, echo=T, message=F}
# Install and load pacman (library management package)
if (!require("pacman")) install.packages("pacman")

# Install and load required packages from CRAN ----
pacman::p_load(ggplot2, dplyr, dplyr, install = FALSE)
```

_**Mac users: **_ You may need to install `gdal` before installing the `sf` package following the instructions here:  
https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/
